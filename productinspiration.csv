Asking GPT-3 About Covid-19,"The current version of GPT-3, however, was only trained on data gathered through October of 2019. That means that GPT-3 has never heard of Covid-19, since the virus only started circulating broadly in December of that year. In testing the system, Thomas Smith from Gado Images wondered what would happen if he taught GPT-3 about Covid-19, and then asked it questions about the pandemic. How would it respond, and would its answers match at all with the reality of how Covid-19 has unfolded?Asking a system like GPT-3 about Covid-19 may one day be more than just an academic exercise. AI systems often lack common sense, but they’re fantastic pattern detectors. In many cases, a well-trained deep learning system can spot patterns which humans would miss. If the world again faced a novel virus similar to Covid-19, future decision-makers could train a system like GPT-3 using what’s known about the novel pathogen, and then ask it targeted questions about the virus itself or the future course of the new pandemic.Such as system could potentially find connections to previous pandemics, similarities to other pathogens, and other useful patterns. It could then use these to guide recommendations, suggest useful public health measures, or even predict the likely course of the novel virus’ spread. Again, while GPT-3’s predictions about Covid-19 weren’t perfect, it got key facts (like the fact that the virus spreads through the air and the importance of mask-wearing) right, using information that would have been available to public health leaders as early as February of 2020.Read the full story at https://onezero.medium.com/i-asked-gpt-3-about-covid-19-its-responses-shocked-me-589267ec41a6",Conversations ,https://gpt3demo.com/apps/gpt-3-covid-19,https://onezero.medium.com/i-asked-gpt-3-about-covid-19-its-responses-shocked-me-589267ec41a6,"Product Type: Conversations

GPT-3 making life easier for customer service agents,"ActiveChat is a smart conversational AI platform with natural language understanding for customer support, e-commerce and marketing chatbots.Activechat has partnered with OpenAI team to build something that looks like real magic. Once you describe the context of your business in a plain natural language and provide a couple of example questions and answers that your human live chat agents may encounter in their day-to-day conversations with customers, we can use the power of GPT-3 to provide instant hints to your agents to help them answer almost any question that a customer may have.Let’s look at a real-life example:GPT-3 as a bike shop assistantThese settings are used as default in Activechat’s GPT-3 integration, and the context for this use case is pretty straightforward:“This is a conversation between a website visitor and a smart virtual assistant. The conversations are happening across various pages of the website that is selling bicycles, and virtual assistant can answer all kinds of questions about various bike brands and models and help choose the right one according to the description made by the visitor.”To seed the AI with some question examples, we used the following:Q: What’s the difference between a carbon and regular bike?
A: The primary difference between carbon and aluminum comes down to weight and ride quality. Carbon frames are usually a bit lighter than aluminum — up to a pound for mountain frames and up to a half-pound on road frames.Q: How much does a good bike cost?
A: Road bikes range between $350 and $700, Mountain bikes around $1000, Single-speed bike — $400, Beach cruiser $200–300, Recumbent bike $1000–2000, and Kids’ bike (3–8 yrs) will be $140–200.Q: How do I service my bike?
A: You should regularly service your bike to ensure it is running efficiently and that there are no worn or damaged components. The more you ride the bike the more frequent you should be servicing it, especially after riding in dirt, sand, mud and in the rain.That’s all it takes to start getting valuable and relevant answer prompts to various kinds of questions that visitors of a bike shop may ask! Here is a real-life example of the conversation completely built from prompts offered by GPT-3, with zero editing by an agent. The only action taken by the agent was choosing which one of the three prompts to use as a response.Clicking any of these hints will copy the answer to the message window, and your agents can send it immediately or edit it, adding specific links to your product pages or other resources. Based on our research, this can reduce the time needed to find and type the answer by 70-80%!If you’re not satisfied with what you see, just hit the “Refresh” icon and a new set of hints will appear. These hints are powered by all knowledge that the Internet has (GPT-3 model is trained on Common Crawl data, Wikipedia, and multiple other data sources, including a huge amount of books). This makes suggested answers sound human-like and in most cases, they will be relevant, useful, and valuable to your customers.Source: https://activechat.ai/news/gpt-3-for-live-chat-makes-life-easier-for-customer-service-agents/",Customer Service ,https://gpt3demo.com/apps/activechat-ai,https://activechat.ai/,"Product Type: Customer Service

Image Captioning with Clip Encoder and GPT2,"Image captioning is a complicated task, where usually a pretrained detection network is used, requires additional supervision in the form of object annotation. We present a new approach that does not requires additional information (i.e. requires only images and captions), thus can be applied to any data. In addition, our model's training time is much faster than similar methods while achieving comparable to state-of-the-art results, even for the Conceptual Captions dataset contains over 3M images.In our work, we use the CLIP model, which was already trained over an extremely large number of images, thus is capable of generating semantic encodings for arbitrary images without additional supervision. To produce meaningful sentences we fine-tune a pretrained language model, which has been proven to be successful for other natural language tasks. The key idea is to use the CLIP encoding as a prefix to the textual captions by employing a simple mapping network over the raw encoding, and then fine-tune our language model to generate a valid caption. In addition, we present another variant, where we utilize a transformer architecture for the mapping network and avoid the fine-tuning of GPT-2.

Using  GPT-3 for IOT Automation,"Waylay is a low-code platform that allows developers to apply enterprise level automation anywhere. Hook up sensors, push data and start enjoying the benefits of low-code automation.Automation rules are the core of the Waylay platform. Developers write small code snippets (or use pre-existing ones) and chain these together with logical operators to define automation rules. Think about rules as something that allow you to turn on the water sprinklers if it has been sunny without rain for 3 days, or schedule an inspection for an industrial machine if an anomaly is detected on one of its many sensors. By chaining these rules together, we can create arbitrarily complex automation software.Making this automation technology accessible to everyone is one of Waylay's core values. Imagine if we could simple interact with this automation engine over voice or text control, in a natural fashion. This is where NLP comes in. Instead of having to interact with a computer in the typical manner, we can foresee a factory worker asking their machine ""What is the temperature of oven 5?"" or telling it ""Raise a critical warning if the temperature of the freezer rises above -10 degrees and the door is open"".Getting this right certainly isn't easy. Human-spoken rules can carry a lot of ambiguity and require a lot of intelligence to correctly parse and translate into Waylay automation rules.The solutionIf we want to build a deep learning solution based on 'traditional' methods, we have a few problems to deal with. Primarily, we are dealing with a lack of data. In order to robustly parse human utterances and capture the necessary information to translate them into something the Waylay system can understand, we would need a large amount of data spanning different ways of speaking and different types of Waylay rules. This data is currently not available. Even if we would have this data, our model would need to be retrained every time we want it to serve a new manner of speaking or a new type of Waylay rule.We turn to prompt engineering to solve our problems. If we can use GPT3 to do the hard work for us, we can build a highly data efficient system which does not need to be retrained to deal with new cases. How nice would that be?The question now becomes ""How can we leverage the capabilities of GPT3 to do the dirty work for us?"". Unfortunately, it is very hard to teach GPT3 to output the correct internal data structure Waylay requires based on a natural language input. Luckily, we can work our way around this with a clever hack (for which we have to credit the smart folks over at Microsoft 3). In our solution, we will let GPT3 output a canonical sentence. This sentence holds the same information as our natural language input, but in a more structured fashion. For example, the utterances 'send David a message telling him to drive safe when it is raining in Paris' and 'only when the weather in Paris is raining tell David ""Drive safe!"" via sms' can both be reduced to the canonical sentence 'if weather in Paris is raining, then send SMS to David with message ""Drive safe!""'.ConclusionBy rephrasing our semantic parsing task to a translation task, we were able to leverage large pre-trained language models (GPT3) to do all the hard work for us. Our solution works with extremely few data points, can easily be adapted towards new situations without retraining and we don't even need to host the deep learning model ourselves. Because of the strong capabilities of GPT3, our solution shows remarkable generalization towards unseen scenarios (and even unseen languages!).Read the full blog post at https://www.waylay.io/articles/nlp-case-study-by-waylay

Can AI Direct Movies? This One Just Did,"All human beings—even famous movie directors like Federico Fellini—have a finite lifespan. But can their talent live on (and continue to create) with artificial intelligence? Maybe so. Campari Red Diaries: Fellini Forward, a short film and behind-the-scenes documentary, premieres at the Venice Film Festival on Sept. 7, and will be featured at the New York Film Festival before an on-demand release in select markets. While there are three humans with directorial credits—Zackary Canepari and Drea Cooper for the documentary, and Maximilian Niemann on the short film—the post-human creative force on this movie is GPT-2, implemented by innovation production studio UNIT9. Meet the Synthetic ScriptwriterBut before any frames were captured in the virtual can, they needed a script. UNIT9 created a custom tool to handle original script generation, building on OpenAI’s GPT-2 (they would have used GPT-3, but it wasn’t out in 2019 when the project started development). This meant the AI settled down to “read” every script Fellini ever wrote, breaking it down into style, context, nomenclature, juxtapositions of concepts, recurring themes/motifs, and so on. Then the AI composed an entirely new script, which is really cool—unless you make your living from writing spec scripts in Hollywood.Source https://www.pcmag.com/news/can-ai-direct-movies-this-one-just-did",Movie Script Writing ,https://gpt3demo.com/apps/red-diaries-fellini-forward-by-campari,https://www.campari.com/red-diaries-fellini-forward,"Product Type: Movie Script Writing
